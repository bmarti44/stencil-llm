# LEDGER — instruction ledger + selective amplification (Brian's architecture)

Authorized 2026-09-01. Supersedes E3 (obligation probe) as the next build;
E3 remains registered as an optional upgrade to ledger entry STATUS.

## Why

Our controller only ever implemented SELECTION (query the current hidden
state against candidate spans, amplify the best). It had no notion of
WHICH text is an instruction, and no persistent set. On Multi-IF it was
selecting over whole user turns — instruction text mixed with narrative —
and fired 0 times in the smoke. Miller's architecture is an active SET of
task rules with gated admission and demand-driven readout; we built the
readout and skipped the set. The project's own surviving results are
ledger properties: the sealed +18.5 win used a structured ledger, and the
focus state was linearly READABLE (87.5%) and TRANSPLANTABLE.

## Components (three, small, independently testable)

A. SALIENCE — does this sentence state a persistent requirement?
   A small classifier over user-turn sentences. This is the piece that
   generalizes: "is this an imperative constraining future output" is a
   LINGUISTIC property, not a benchmark property (unlike the checker
   dependency that blocked the obligation gate).
   Labels, free: our synthetic corpora are labeled by construction
   (constraint sentences vs task/filler sentences); IFEval 541 +
   Multi-IF give real positives; ordinary narrative sentences from the
   same prompts give negatives.
   Gate A: held-out F1 >= 0.90 on a LEAVE-ONE-CORPUS-OUT split, and
   >= 0.80 on a hand-labeled sample of 100 Multi-IF sentences the
   classifier never saw. Must be honest about false positives — an
   over-inclusive ledger is the failure mode that killed the raw-span
   version.

B. LEDGER — the held set.
   Entries: {text, token span, pooled trunk key (h20 mean over the span),
   turn introduced, status}. Status is OPTIONAL and defaults to "unknown";
   E3's probe can fill it later. The ledger is explicit and auditable by
   construction (Brian's standing requirement: "transplanting the focus
   and auditing it quickly and easily").

C. SELECTION + EMPHASIS — the EXISTING WaveController, unchanged.
   Query = current h20; keys = ledger entry keys; top-k selected; sustained
   bias over the selected entries' spans (the Opus-validated actuator).
   The ONLY change vs today: keys come from the curated ledger instead of
   raw prompt spans.

## The experiment that decides it (registered BEFORE building)

The trivial version of a ledger already works: re-appending instructions
as text is published at +22.3pts on multi-turn IF. Brian's ruling
(2026-09-01) sets the bar precisely: WE DO NOT HAVE TO BEAT TEXT
RE-APPEND. WE HAVE TO MATCH IT FOR FREE, AND AUTOMATICALLY.

  "for free"        = ZERO added context tokens (text re-append pays
                      tokens linear in the number of instructions and
                      grows every turn; the neural ledger pays none).
  "match"           = NON-INFERIORITY, not superiority. Registered test:
                      the existing Tango paired bound (src/stencil/
                      stats.py), margin 2.0 points, one-sided 95%.
                      A tie at zero cost is a WIN.
  "automatically"   = the ledger is built by the salience classifier from
                      raw text. No "Constraint:" markers, no human
                      curation, no per-benchmark verifiers at inference.
                      An arm that needs marked spans does not count.

ARMS (replayed-history harness, identical inputs, single difference):
  1. base                 — recorded native (free, already on disk)
  2. text-ledger          — the SAME ledger entries re-appended verbatim
                            before the assistant turn (the baseline to beat)
  3. neural-ledger        — ledger entries as attention-bias targets,
                            selective amplification, context UNCHANGED
  4. specificity control  — matched bias mass on non-ledger tokens
PRIMARY (registered): NON-INFERIORITY of neural_ledger to text_ledger on
per-constraint paired outcomes — Tango upper bound on the drop < 2.0
points — WITH neural_ledger context cost = 0 added tokens. That is the
result: same compliance, no context paid, no human in the loop.
SECONDARY: neural_ledger vs BASE (it must do something at all) and
text_ledger vs BASE (confirms the ledger contents are right, and
calibrates the addressable headroom on this harness).
Context tokens added MUST be reported per arm.
SCOPE HONESTY: the actuator can only INSERT content; limit/removal/
restructure families are reported separately and excluded from the primary
(measured: insertable families are 18.5% of Multi-IF constraints).
Slice first: the disclosed diagnostic conversations (~113), ~3 GPU-h.

## Build rules

Small. Three files max: src/stencil/salience.py, src/stencil/ledger.py,
scripts/ledger_eval.py. Reuse ctrb/e2/bench helpers; do not re-implement
generation, spans, or scoring. Red/green TDD; NO vacuous tests (assert on
decoded content and bounded properties). No training beyond the salience
classifier. No new corpora unless a gate demands it.

## Brian's rulings, 2026-09-01 (after the first build)

1. SALIENCE-2 — the finder must be far more general. The v1 regex/logistic
   detector (recall ~0.75, misses buried constraints) is a stopgap. Required:
   - BURIED instructions: constraints inside task sentences ("Write a blog
     post with at least 300 words" -> the clause "with at least 300 words").
     Clause-level spans, not sentence-level.
   - NON-ADDITIVE instructions must be DETECTED just as well: prohibitions
     ("do not", "never", "avoid"), limits ("under 90 words", "at most"),
     tone/manner ("be formal", "sound angry"), format ("in JSON", "as a
     list"). Detection is the ledger's job regardless of whether the
     actuator can act on an entry; what to DO with each entry is a separate
     decision (the actuator's insertion-only limit stays a known, separately
     reported boundary).
   - Being welded to Qwen3-1.7B is FINE (Brian) — the finder MAY read the
     trunk's own hidden states (a token-level span probe) rather than regex.
   GATES (registered): recall >= 0.90 AND precision >= 0.90 on a BLIND
   hand-labeled Multi-IF sample at CLAUSE level; leave-one-corpus-out F1
   >= 0.90; and a TRANSFER test on IFBench prompts (a constraint taxonomy
   the finder never trained on) with F1 reported honestly. Hand-labels are
   reviewed by sol (conflict-of-interest rule).

2. DEPLOY — "super easy for people to use". Target: a pip-installable
   package on top of HuggingFace transformers' Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B (not our
   hand-rolled trunk), exposing one entry point (load model -> generate with
   the ledger on), with salience + ledger + controller weights on the HF
   Hub. Must pass a PARITY test against our verified path (logits within the
   registered drift bound; ledger spans identical). transformers==4.51.0 is
   the known-good pin (bitwise template verification, B0).

3. SEQUENCING: the diagnostic slice still runs with the v1 finder once sol
   clears the build — an UNDER-inclusive ledger only weakens the neural arm,
   so a positive is conservative and a negative is informative about the
   architecture rather than the finder. SALIENCE-2 replaces v1 when it
   passes its gates; DEPLOY packages whatever passes.

## LEDGER-KV (Brian, 2026-09-01): the ledger lives in pinned KV slots

Problem with the in-context ledger: entries point at instruction spans that
must still be IN the context window. Under truncation/compaction — the norm
in long agentic sessions — there is nothing to point at, and "zero context
cost" only holds where re-appending is cheap anyway.

Design: when an instruction enters the ledger, PIN its per-layer K/V columns
(the tensors the trunk computed when it first read those tokens) so they
survive eviction. Later turns attend to the pinned slots; the wave amplifies
attention toward the slots of the selected entries. This makes "out of
reach" LITERAL — the regime of the program's one decisive win (+18.5
sealed: information provably beyond attention's reach, carried by the
wave) — and it is what long-horizon agentic use actually needs (turn 3's
rule binding at turn 200 across compactions). Cost ~115 KB per pinned
token over 28 layers; a hundred instruction tokens is negligible.

Known risk: RoPE bakes position into K. A pinned K from position 50
attended from 5000 after eviction has a distorted relative distance.
StreamingLLM-style evidence says trunks tolerate this with sinks, but it
is EMPIRICAL for Qwen3-1.7B.

GATE (feasibility probe, registered before building): on >= 20 synthetic
multi-turn sessions, evict the middle turns from context, pin the ledger
entries' KV, and measure late-turn adherence for (a) evicted-no-pin,
(b) evicted-pinned, (c) evicted-pinned + wave amplification, (d) full
context (ceiling). Pinning must recover a material fraction of the
(d)-(a) gap without degeneracy (perplexity/length checks). If (b) is
degenerate, position-handling (re-indexing pinned K, or a sink) is the
next design question, not more amplification. Sequenced AFTER the
in-context diagnostic slice (the baseline) and reusing its harness.
Deploy must keep bias injection abstract over ATTENTION COLUMNS, not
context spans, so pinned slots drop in later.

## Amendments after sol's verification (2026-09-01, results/ledger-verify-sol.md)

- RETRACTED: "an under-inclusive ledger only weakens the neural arm". It
  weakens BOTH arms, reduces discordance, and makes non-inferiority
  EASIER. Hence primary validity now REQUIRES non-vacuity: text_ledger
  must beat base (n10 > n01 on eligible outcomes) and the ledger must be
  active (>= 1 aged entry selected) on every credited turn.
- ESTIMAND: eligible outcomes = AGED (origin turn < current turn)
  constraints in FIXABLE_FAMILIES only; fresh constraints are excluded
  from the primary (the treatment holds aged entries only).
- CLUSTERING: the primary bound is a CONVERSATION-CLUSTERED one-sided 95%
  upper bound on the mean paired difference (text - neural, points),
  cluster = conversation, via t on the per-conversation mean differences
  (fallback: cluster bootstrap, 2000 resamples, seed 0). Tango on pooled
  cells is reported as descriptive only.
- SLICE STATUS: the ~113-conversation diagnostic slice is a FALSIFICATION
  SCREEN (all-concordant bound already exceeds the margin at n=85); a
  confirmatory NI needs the complete 909-conversation cohort and is a
  separate registered run.
- VALIDITY GATE (primary_claim_valid): complete cohort; registered
  top_k/dose/max_new/deadline; neural context tokens MEASURED per turn (not
  a literal); timeouts+truncations <= 2% per arm; real-salience path
  asserted (segmenter identity check); provenance hashes cover
  salience_weights.json, qwen3.py, ctrb.py, e2.py, stats.py, tokenizer,
  and the vendored verifier tree.
- CONTROL: specificity = width- and position-matched NON-ledger spans at
  the SAME dose (mass_matched_nonconstraint_control from e2.py), reported
  directly against neural (neural - specificity, clustered bound).
- LINKAGE: each ledger entry records the instruction_ids whose constraint
  clause it overlaps (e2.constraint_span_records); credit is only counted
  where the credited constraint's entry was selected.
- top_k=2 and dose 3.0 are FROZEN EXPLORATORY choices; not tuned after
  outcomes are viewed.
- FIX-ROUND readings (2026-09-01, flagged for sol re-verification):
  (i) Multi-IF has no "Constraint:" markers, so entry<->instruction linkage
  is ORIGIN-TURN granularity (entry links to every id its turn introduced);
  disclosed in records as linkage_granularity; mildly lenient to neural.
  (ii) the matched control is ledger.matched_nonledger_control (same-width,
  nearest-position windows disjoint from every entry, same dose), NOT
  e2.mass_matched_nonconstraint_control (which is the diffuse complement).
  (iii) "credit only when selected": an uncredited neural pass scores as a
  FAIL (fail-closed), not an excluded pair; raw rate reported alongside.
- SALIENCE-2 RESULT (2026-09-01, v2b clean refit after the IFEval-training
  breach, see WORKLOG): gate 1 UNMET on two blind Multi-IF draws — recall
  0.854 / 0.884 vs bar 0.90 (precision 0.95 / 0.94); LOCO F1 0.973/0.945
  (met, linguistic backend); IFBench transfer F1 0.68 (reported); buried
  recall 0.88 linguistic / 0.97 trunk-probe. DEFAULT_BACKEND=linguistic
  (CPU-only, deploy-friendly). Unmet gate kept as a strict xfail with the
  numbers. Brian decides: accept 0.88 recall as v2, or fund a third round
  (blind-draw failures are new constructions each time — rule overfit risk).
- LEDGER-KV PROBE RESULT (2026-09-01, 20 synthetic sessions, 56 aged
  constraints, results/qwen/ledger-kv-probe): full 42/56, evicted 16/56,
  pinned 36/56, pinned+wave(3.0) 35/56. Pinning recovers 0.77 of the
  full-evicted gap (paired 14 better / 1 worse), degeneracy 2/20 vs 1/20
  evicted → GATE MET under the no-reindex position policy. The wave dose on
  pinned columns adds NOTHING and degenerates 8/20 (truncations 9 vs 4):
  the pinned MEMORY is the mechanism; amplification of it is harmful here,
  consistent with the always-on-bias finding (B3 dev gate). Pending
  independent verification before any design decision.
