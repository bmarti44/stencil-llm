# LEDGER — instruction ledger + selective amplification (Brian's architecture)

Authorized 2026-09-01. Supersedes E3 (obligation probe) as the next build;
E3 remains registered as an optional upgrade to ledger entry STATUS.

## Why

Our controller only ever implemented SELECTION (query the current hidden
state against candidate spans, amplify the best). It had no notion of
WHICH text is an instruction, and no persistent set. On Multi-IF it was
selecting over whole user turns — instruction text mixed with narrative —
and fired 0 times in the smoke. Miller's architecture is an active SET of
task rules with gated admission and demand-driven readout; we built the
readout and skipped the set. The project's own surviving results are
ledger properties: the sealed +18.5 win used a structured ledger, and the
focus state was linearly READABLE (87.5%) and TRANSPLANTABLE.

## Components (three, small, independently testable)

A. SALIENCE — does this sentence state a persistent requirement?
   A small classifier over user-turn sentences. This is the piece that
   generalizes: "is this an imperative constraining future output" is a
   LINGUISTIC property, not a benchmark property (unlike the checker
   dependency that blocked the obligation gate).
   Labels, free: our synthetic corpora are labeled by construction
   (constraint sentences vs task/filler sentences); IFEval 541 +
   Multi-IF give real positives; ordinary narrative sentences from the
   same prompts give negatives.
   Gate A: held-out F1 >= 0.90 on a LEAVE-ONE-CORPUS-OUT split, and
   >= 0.80 on a hand-labeled sample of 100 Multi-IF sentences the
   classifier never saw. Must be honest about false positives — an
   over-inclusive ledger is the failure mode that killed the raw-span
   version.

B. LEDGER — the held set.
   Entries: {text, token span, pooled trunk key (h20 mean over the span),
   turn introduced, status}. Status is OPTIONAL and defaults to "unknown";
   E3's probe can fill it later. The ledger is explicit and auditable by
   construction (Brian's standing requirement: "transplanting the focus
   and auditing it quickly and easily").

C. SELECTION + EMPHASIS — the EXISTING WaveController, unchanged.
   Query = current h20; keys = ledger entry keys; top-k selected; sustained
   bias over the selected entries' spans (the Opus-validated actuator).
   The ONLY change vs today: keys come from the curated ledger instead of
   raw prompt spans.

## The experiment that decides it (registered BEFORE building)

The trivial version of a ledger already works: re-appending instructions
as text is published at +22.3pts on multi-turn IF. So the question is NOT
"does a ledger help" but "does a NEURAL ledger beat a TEXTUAL one, at a
fraction of the context cost".

ARMS (replayed-history harness, identical inputs, single difference):
  1. base                 — recorded native (free, already on disk)
  2. text-ledger          — the SAME ledger entries re-appended verbatim
                            before the assistant turn (the baseline to beat)
  3. neural-ledger        — ledger entries as attention-bias targets,
                            selective amplification, context UNCHANGED
  4. specificity control  — matched bias mass on non-ledger tokens
PRIMARY: per-constraint paired outcomes, neural-ledger vs BASE (does it
help at all) AND neural-ledger vs text-ledger (does it earn its existence).
Report context cost (tokens added) per arm — the neural arm's whole claim
is parity-at-lower-cost.
SCOPE HONESTY: the actuator can only INSERT content; limit/removal/
restructure families are reported separately and excluded from the primary
(measured: insertable families are 18.5% of Multi-IF constraints).
Slice first: the disclosed diagnostic conversations (~113), ~3 GPU-h.

## Build rules

Small. Three files max: src/stencil/salience.py, src/stencil/ledger.py,
scripts/ledger_eval.py. Reuse ctrb/e2/bench helpers; do not re-implement
generation, spans, or scoring. Red/green TDD; NO vacuous tests (assert on
decoded content and bounded properties). No training beyond the salience
classifier. No new corpora unless a gate demands it.
